## 📌 Objective

To build a regression model that can predict the total first-innings score based on:
- Current match progress (overs, runs, wickets)
- Teams involved
- Venue
- On-field players (batsmen and bowlers)

---

## 📊 Workflow

### 1. Data Collection
- IPL match data is collected from Kaggle or similar sources.
- Data includes match stats, teams, players, venue, runs, overs, etc.

### 2. Data Preprocessing
- Handling missing values
- Encoding categorical variables (Label Encoding / One-Hot Encoding)
- Dropping irrelevant features

### 3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Visualization of scores across teams and venues
- Distribution analysis of runs and overs
- Correlation analysis of numerical features

### 4. Feature Engineering
- Extracting meaningful features like:
  - Total wickets fallen
  - Run rate
  - Match progress

### 5. Model Building
- Models used:
  - Linear Regression
  - Decision Tree Regressor
  - Random Forest Regressor

- Performance Metrics:
  - Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
  - Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
  - R² Score

### 6. Model Evaluation
- Compare models and select the best based on validation performance
- Visualize predictions vs actual scores
